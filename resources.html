<p class="resourceText"><b>Reflect.</b>  Spend time reflecting on the biases that you might have—almost everyone holds some form of bias.  Think through how those biases might have been formed and if there is any sound logic or reason to to them.</p>
    
<p class="resourceText"><b>Confront.</b>  Consider why you might be holding onto a bias.  Is it because of fear—a preventative measure based on a bad experience?  Is it because of security--a crutch that helps you feel better about yourself?  Is it avoidance—a way to dodge difficult situations with groups you don’t understand or that make you uncomfortable?</p>
    
<p class="resourceText"><b>Engage.</b>  One of the best ways to eliminate a bias is to prove it wrong through personal experience and engagement.  We’re all professionals and we can draw on each other to help improve our workplace.  Engage in a conversation with someone different from yourself.  Get to know them as an individual and take note of how they dispel the biases you might hold.</p>
    
<p class="resourceText"><b>Commit.</b>  Commit to experiencing individuals, not groups.  Remember that everyone is a unique individual, not a stereotype of a group.  Make your relationships about the individual, not about group membership.</p>
    
<p class="resourceText"><b>Maintain.</b>  Keep making connections with individuals—embrace each opportunity to meet and experience a new person and appreciate the differences and unique elements that make that person who they are.  </p> 
    
            <p class="resourceText"><b>Discuss.</b>  Talk about your experiences with bias and with overcoming biases.  Encourage others to talk about their experiences.  Use discussion to help point out lingering blind spots and to continue building a bias-free workplace.</p>
